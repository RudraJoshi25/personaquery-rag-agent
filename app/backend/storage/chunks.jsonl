They are confined to simply paraplegic people. Along these lines, for Quadriplegic individuals, this model miserably fails. Advancements in innovation lead us to another approach to control wheelchairs ; utilising brain signals of an individual. With the assistance of a similar strategy, We propose a system wherein the individual on a wheelchair will be given a keen headband to control the wheelchair based on neural signals or brain waves emitted from the brain utilising technologies like Brain-Computer Interface(BCI), Electrooculography (EOG) and Electroencephalography (EEG). Subsequent to applying these technologies on a small wheelchair model, we have gotten incredible accuracy of the neural-signals . Thus the results are quite astonishing. Apart from this, in future aspects considering the safety of passengers, if anything obstructing the way of the wheelchair comes too close; causing the person to lose their concentration, the wheelchair will sense the obstacle and will apply brakes immediately.

{"text": "WHO estimates that about 15 percent of the world's population has one or more disabilities, and that between 2 to 4 percent of those people have difficulty working. The global prevalence of disability is higher than previous WHO estimates from the 1970s, which put the rate at around 10%. [1]. In order to get around and get from one place to another , people with these disabilities always need some assistance. Wheelchairs have been in daily use for Paraplegic and Quadriplegic people since the dawn of technology . The development of wheelchairs has made it easier for people with disabilities to cope with their situation. Assistance or any external effort is always required to move when using the first generation of wheelchairs that were manually operated. An electric wheelchair was also developed in order to eliminate the need for external effort or other assistance but it has its own drawbacks. EEG (Electroencephalography) and EOG (Electrooculography) are two newly known technologies used to control the wheelchair by a paraplegic/quadiplegic person's brain and movements of eyes. Most of the external work would be eliminated if this system were introduced to society . A. Background 1.

The two most prevalent types of wheelchairs are manual wheelchairs and electric wheelchairs. The first is the standard wheelchair , which is used by the vast majority of persons with disabilities. In general, the chair has two large wheels that allow it to travel forward, backward, left, and right. To move the chair forward, we must push both wheels ahead, and to move the chair backward, we must push both wheels backward. Turning left requires pushing on the left side, while turning right requires pushing on the right side.[39,40] A Joystick Controlled Wheelchair is the second most used wheelchair in the market after the manual wheelchair . The joystick directs the motorised wheelchair in the direction indicated by the user. The faster the joystick is pushed, the faster the electric wheelchair will travel. When you let go of the joystick, the brakes are applied automatically . The motorised wheelchair will then come to a complete stop.Individuals who are unable to utilise a joystick may be able to use non-proportional controls.[41, 46] A.

EEG headband( Electroencephalography )- Electroencephalography (EEG) is a technique for recording the electrical activities of the brain that involves inserting electrodes on the erson’'s scalp. It typically detects the voltage changes within the brain's neurons. Previously , it was primarily employed by medical organisations, but this technology is currently being used in a variety of other industries. The electrodes of EEG headbands record brain wave patterns, which are subsequently sent to a computer or any other cloud service platform [16]. 2. EOG headband (Electrooculography)- The cornea-positive standing potential relative to the rear of the eye is measured by EOG. The potential can be measured by having the patient travel a certain distance after placing skin electrodes outside the eye near the lateral and medial canthus. It basically investigates abnormalities of the retina's outermost layer , the retinal pigment epithelium, by recording the eye whenever a voltage differential between the cornea and the retina may be observed. These bioelectrical impulses are often low in amplitude, necessitating the use of an amplifier to accurately record the EOG.

Whereas smartphones necessitate the use of a Bluetooth terminal application for data transmission and reception. It manages the wireless network's communication channel clearly and without any form of delay .[17]. 5. Motor driver- The motor driver enables the control of DC motors by converting the microcontroller's low current output into a greater current suited for motor control.[15]. 6. DC motors- A direct current (DC) motor is a sort of electric machine that transfers electrical energy into mechanical energy . It accepts direct current and turns it into mechanical rotations.

The control segment, space segment, and user segment are the three key parts that make up the GPS module's operation.

A gyroscope is a device that measures the rotation of the earth's axis. It can determine the article's slant and horizontal direction, whereas an accelerometer can only measure straight movement [7]. 11. Speedometer- The speedometer sensor is located in the vehicle's transmission and is used to track the rotational speed of the driveshaft. The sensor sends this information to the vehicle's PC via the speedometer link, which converts an electrical pulse into a numerical speed. In the end, the figure appears on the speedometer and tells you exactly how fast you're travelling [6]. B. Software 1.
